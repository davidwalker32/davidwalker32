👀 I’m interested in exploring the intersection of art and technology, particularly in creative coding and interactive installations.

🌱 I’m currently learning Processing and experimenting with generative art to blend code and creativity.

💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects that merge art and tech or explore innovative ways to interact with digital art.
